"""Readable address-range maps and the operations on them.

Each address space a component reads has one of three kinds of map. An
unconstrained space has no map and is planned gap-based. A declared map is
what the author stated in ``register_ranges`` and its siblings: the addresses
the device answers. A claimed map is what a component reads on its own,
planned alone. It stands in where the author declared nothing.

Two rules govern a merge. Declarations draw boundaries and conflict where they
overlap without matching, because they describe one device. Claims draw no
boundary and overlap freely, because they only say that something reads those
addresses. A merged map therefore never widens a read past a split a
declaration drew, and never bridges a gap no part reads.
